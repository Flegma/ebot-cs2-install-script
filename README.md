# ebot-cs2-install-script
Installation script for eBot that works with CS2. Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 (Hetzner Cloud). 
I will be updating the script with new stuff, this is only first release because many people reached out to me to help them install their own versions.

RUN THE SCRIPT AS ROOT (everything should be pretty straighforward):

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flegma/ebot-cs2-install-script/main/ebot-cs2-install.sh && chmod +x ebot-cs2-install.sh && ./ebot-cs2-install.sh
